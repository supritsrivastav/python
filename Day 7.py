#Operators
print(15+7)  #Addition Operator
print(15-7)   # Subtraction Operator
print(15*7)  #Multiplication Operator
print(15/7)  # Division Operator
print(15%7)  # Modulus Operator
print(15//7)  # Floor Division Operator
print(15**7)  # Exponential operator
# binary operator:- requires at least two operand
# pre increment:-++a
# post increment:-a++
# Realtional Operator:- output hamesha true or false aayegi
# a=b :- assignment operator takes the value of assigned value .
# Bitwise Operator :- works on a bits of of an operand i.e:-$,|,^,~.
# Conditional Operator :- It works upon a three operands  i.e:- condition ? if true :if false
# Shift Operator :- Shifting the bit to the left or right as per the given condition is given i.e :->>,<<,>>>...
# Instance of Operator :- means Object of a class



#------------------ Type Conversion------------------------------------- 
# Converting the small data type to the bigger data type size i.e :- byte---short
# Conversion Hierarchy
# byte<short<int<long<double.
# Explicit TypeCasting is converting the one data type to another by manually 
# For Example :-  int a=(int)23.47

# Precedece $Associativity 
# Precedence	Operator	Type	Associativity
# Read by Mine
# integer Caching :-Helps to improve the performance anusage memory having the ranges -127 to128
