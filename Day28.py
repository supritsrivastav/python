# Uses of f-String in python
# f-String means formatted String  and it is used to plug in the value into the statement 
# It replaces the formated string with the given input
# Earlier in Python the formating of string is done by using the format method 
letter="Hey my name is {} and i am from {}"
country="India"
name="Suprit" 
# print(letter.format(name,country))

# Where as by using the f-String the syntax is so simple to use ..
print(f"Hey my name is {name} and i am from {country}")
